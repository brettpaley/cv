  <p><strong> Professional Summary: </strong>An entrepreneurial-minded analyst focused on empowering the business leaders I support to make data-driven decisions that inform our ecommerce strategy. </p>
  <p><strong>Professional Bio: </strong>After completing my undergraduate studies,
    I was intrigued by the Data Analyst career path for two reasons. Firstly, through the use of SQL and Python, data analysts have
    access to more data than a traditional financial or business analyst would normally have, giving me the freedom to explore beyond
    what's available in standard reporting tools. Secondly, it provided me with an inside look at what types of analyses and reports
    were most important to business leaders and what decisions they aimed to make with these resources.
    Understanding how leaders leverage insights from their organization's data to grow and optimize revenue seemed to me like a formula
    I could learn and later replicate in the future. </p>
  <p> <strong>Career Highlights: </strong>Although I am at the beginning of my career,
    I have been fortunate enough to be a part of a multitude of projects and initiatives
    that have allowed me to work with stakeholders from several different teams within The Knot Worldwide.
    I have conducted several different types of analyses including:
  <ul>
    <li>Sales forecasting</li>
    <li>Retailer market share analyses</li>
    <li>Web traffic and conversions by platform</li>
    <li>User cohort and lifetime value analysis</li>
    <li>Grid sensitivity analysis</li>
  </ul>

  These analyses have supported stakeholders and business leaders from various professional backgrounds including:
  <ul>

    <li>Finance</li>
    <li>Software </li>
    <li>Digital Advertising </li>
    <li>Business Development </li>
    <li>Content & Email Marketing </li>
  </ul> Throughought all of these projects I have focused on tying
  insights to their potential impact to revenue. As my roles and responsibilities have evolved with my skills over time,
  I've gone from forecasting revenue in excel all the way to executing the very
  scripts that calculate it using SQL.
